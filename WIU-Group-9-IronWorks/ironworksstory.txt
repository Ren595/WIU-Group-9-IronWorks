Bergmann was a miner at the German Miner Association back in the 1950s.
After a few run-ins with the law, Bergmann was dismissed from the German Miner Association. Rumors spread that he had been skimming a little too much gold from the shipments and cutting corners on safety inspections.
Whether true or not, the Association didn't care -- his reputation was stained. It was over for him.
Bergmann: What??
Boss: You're fired, no questions asked. 
Boss: I don't want to see your face ever again.
Bergmann: Ok, fine!
Frustrated, he walks back home.
Bergmann: Maybe I shouldn't have done that to the boss...
He takes one look at his now empty wallet.
Bergmann: I don't think I even have enough money to buy a single Hamburger or Bratwurst from that stall.
Dejected, he passes by his once familiar workplace in the mine.
It was at that stage that he had a vision.
"What if I create my own mining and smelting business to rival theirs?"
His resolve to get revenge on Germany's mining and smelting economy burned bright in his heart.
All he needed was a mine and a factory.
Over the next few days, he starts to plan out his future business.
Finding abandoned factories and mines.
The counterattack begins.

Bergmann was a miner at the German Miner Association back in the 1950s.
After a few run-ins with the law, Bergmann was dismissed from the German Miner Association. Rumors spread that he had been skimming a little too much gold from the shipments and cutting corners on safety inspections.
Whether true or not, the Association didn't care -- his reputation was stained. It was over for him.
Bergmann: What??
Boss: You're fired, no questions asked. I don't want to see your face ever again.
Bergmann: Ok, fine!
He then decided to create his own mining and smelting business to get revenge on Germany's mining and smelting economy.
